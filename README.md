##FizzBuzz Kata

This project contains an implementation of the classic "FizzBuzz" programming kata in Java, along with unit tests to verify its correct functionality.

##Description

FizzBuzz is a popular problem in technical interviews that assesses basic programming skills. The objective is to print numbers from 1 to 100, but with the following conditions:

For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
For all other numbers, print the number itself.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following parts:

Main.java: Contains the main logic of the FizzBuzz program.
FizzBuzzTest.java: Contains unit tests for the FizzBuzz logic using JUnit 5.

Usage

##Running the Program
To run the program, you can compile and execute the Main.java file. This will print the FizzBuzz results for numbers from 1 to 100.

##Unit Tests
The unit tests are included in the FizzBuzzTest.java file. These tests use JUnit 5 to verify that the FizzBuzz logic behaves correctly. To run the unit tests, make sure you have JUnit 5 configured in your development environment.
